"""Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing a music album.
The function should take in an artist name , an album title,and  an optional parameter to make_album()
that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the
number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at least one new function call that
includes the number of tracks on an album."""
