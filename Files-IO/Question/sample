I have a beautiful garden in my backyard. In the garden, colorful flowers bloom throughout the year.
I enjoy spending my weekends tending to the garden's various plants. The garden attracts a variety
of birds and butterflies. I often invite friends over for tea in the garden. The tranquility of the
garden provides a welcome escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life.
